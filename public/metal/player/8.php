        <p class="character-text"> You are renowned for your talent to slip in and out of places almost unnoticed, earning you the role of a witness to numerous peculiar situations and a keeper of secret knowledge. You have a fascination for observing things not intended for the public eye, often exploring underground and visiting places where nobody recognizes you. Maintaining your anonymity is crucial, and you are a master of disguise. Your unusual passion has turned you into an expert on the city's underground, the mysterious locations, and its undiscovered nooks and crannies. Additionally, you possess a unique gift: you can communicate with cats. These conversations with felines grant you an even deeper understanding of the city's peculiar and enigmatic corners.<br><br>
        You've known Nine since your teenage years, having met while volunteering at an animal shelter, which led to a strong friendship. However, in recent times, it seems that your relationship with Nine has become strained. You feel she has let you down on several occasions, as she appears to be increasingly self-focused. You suspect her recent behaviour is an attempt to seek attention, which somewhat annoys you. Like this story she told the other day where she thought there was someone cloning her on the internet, she is definitely overestimating her own importance.<br><br>
        Your fascination lies in the power of radio to amplify voices and disseminate messages. You firmly believe that not only human voices but also those of animals should be heard. Consequently, you ensure there is ample animal-related content on the radio, and occasionally, you organize listening sessions for animals.<br><br>
        Despite the reservations held by most 868Mhz members regarding Rotterdam's smart city development, you find the bonuses and credits offered by the platform quite attractive and don't want to miss out.<br><br>
